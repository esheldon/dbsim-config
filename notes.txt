- seeing big bias for 4 objects. maybe not too surprising, the density
  is quite high, 51/sq arcmin.  But note the density is really higher
  because they are distributed as a gaussian around the center.
  
  In any case, I want to explore it a little

    - uberseg
        - can only do it for both now....
        - mcal-002
        - R considerably less wide *in the tails*
        - running some more to better test shear
        - huh... got higher bias this time

    - simpler model for MOF

    - priors
        - tighter prior on cen
        - looser prior on cen
        - better prior on size and flux
        - tighter prior on fracdev

    - metacal the whole scene some how
        - currently not set up to do this
        - already know the cheating metacal works

- doing more realistic scenes for DES
    - larger images
    - objects placed randomly, uniformly
        - maybe putting down some clusters too
    - try to get the density of detections about right, or the effective
      number density
