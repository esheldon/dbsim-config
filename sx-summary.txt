    - ANALYSIS_THRESH 1.5 # I think it must be same?

    - DEBLEND_NTHRESH 64
    - DEBLEND_MINCONT 0.00001

    - gives none in 4000 two obj found frac

    - but also note for the same objects at 8 pix separation
    27% of the time none are found
    70% 1
    3% 2

    The 27% no detect means there will be a detection bias I predict,
    but it is also mixed with the problem of 1 vs 2

    - note I had run with minarea 9 before and still saw the spurious detections,
      so the DETECT_THRESH is also important here
